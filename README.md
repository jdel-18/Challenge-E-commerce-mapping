# Challenge-E-commerce-mapping
 
## Description
This challenge was to create a back end for an e-commerce website so that it can compete with other e-commerce companies. I built this project to get more experience using insomnia and working with backend code. There was code included with the project but I had to add the code to talk to the backend so I can look at the products.

## Installation
Open the project on VScode and right click on the file and open "open in integrated terminal" and type in "npm i" to install required packages. 

## Usage
Type "node start" and copy the localhost route to insomnia.
